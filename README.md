# WHATEVERLY...
is a project that was intended for the developer to solidify their knowledge of React, datasets, navigating datasets, array prototypes, fetch API, object oriented programming, and working with other developers in a group setting.

# TECH / FRAMEWORKS USED

- React
- Sass
- JSX
- fetch API
- Testing with Enzyme & Jest

# WHAT WE LEARNED

We learned how to coordinate work across a larger group of people than we've worked with in the past. We were able to really dive deeper into React and work with components and how they interact with one another. We learned how to write effective tests in Enzyme as well as how to write Sass for more efficient CSS.

# WISH LIST / WHAT'S LEFT / FUTURE ITERATIONS

- We wanted to add an odometer for the count of floats for each pop up.

- We had been hoping to randomize the restaurants that appear for a user's choice but we were unable to get that far.

- We had also been hoping to implement some visual content but simply ran out of time after prioritizing our MVP.

# PROJECT WINS & CHALLENGES

We started off with three filter functions, one for each option but when we worked with combining them we were able to rewrite them all into a single function which handles all three user options.

This function caused us much heartache on the main Parade Planner code, so it also caused us issues when we tested it. It wasn't bad in retrospect, but it was our most thoughtout test considering it handles a large portion of our functionality.

Another big win we had was to reset our drop down bars. We had some issues with how exactly we could reset their value but it ended up being a pretty quick and easy fix!
